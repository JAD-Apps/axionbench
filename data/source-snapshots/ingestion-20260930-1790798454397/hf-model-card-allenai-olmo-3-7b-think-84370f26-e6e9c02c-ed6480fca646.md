# Model Card for Olmo 3 Think

We introduce Olmo 3, a new family of 7B and 32B models both Instruct and Think variants. Long chain-of-thought thinking improves reasoning tasks like math and coding.

Olmo is a series of **O**pen **l**anguage **mo**dels designed to enable the science of language models. 
These models are pre-trained on the Dolma 3 dataset and post-trained on the Dolci datasets. We are releasing all code, checkpoints, logs (coming soon), and associated training details. 



The core models released in this batch include the following:

## Installation

Olmo 3 is supported in transformers 4.57.0 or higher:
```bash
pip install transformers>=4.57.0
```

## Inference

You can use OLMo with the standard HuggingFace transformers library:
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
olmo = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("allenai/Olmo-3-7B-Think")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("allenai/Olmo-3-7B-Think")
message = ["Who would win in a fight - a dinosaur or a cow named Moo Moo?"]
inputs = tokenizer(message, return_tensors='pt', return_token_type_ids=False)
# optional verifying cuda
# inputs = {k: v.to('cuda') for k,v in inputs.items()}
# olmo = olmo.to('cuda')
response = olmo.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=100, do_sample=True, top_k=50, top_p=0.95)
print(tokenizer.batch_decode(response, skip_special_tokens=True)[0])
>> '<think>Okay, so the question is who would win in a fight...'
```

For faster performance, you can quantize the model using the following method:
```python
AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("allenai/Olmo-3-7B-Think", 
    torch_dtype=torch.float16, 
    load_in_8bit=True)  # Requires bitsandbytes
```
The quantized model is more sensitive to data types and CUDA operations. To avoid potential issues, it's recommended to pass the inputs directly to CUDA using:
```python
inputs.input_ids.to('cuda')
```

We have released checkpoints for these models. For post-training, the naming convention is `step_XXXX`. 


To load a specific model revision with HuggingFace, simply add the argument `revision`:
```bash
olmo = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("allenai/Olmo-3-7B-Think", revision="step_1375")
```

Or, you can access all the revisions for the models via the following code snippet:
```python
from huggingface_hub import list_repo_refs
out = list_repo_refs("allenai/Olmo-3-7B-Think")
branches = [b.name for b in out.branches]
```

<think>Okay, so the question is who would win in a fight between a dinosaur and a cow named Moo Moo.
Hmm, first I need to break this down. Let me think about the different factors involved here..... </think>
Moo Moo the cow would certinaly win.

## Inference & Recommended Settings
We evaluated our models on the following settings. We also recommend using them for generation:
- **temperature:** `0.6`
- **top_p:** `0.95`
- **max_tokens:** `32768`

### transformers Example
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_id = "allenai/Olmo-3-7B-Think"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_id,
    device_map="auto",
)

prompt = "Who would win in a fight - a dinosaur or a cow named MooMoo?"
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

outputs = model.generate(
    **inputs,
    temperature=0.6,
    top_p=0.95,
    max_new_tokens=32768,
)

print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

### vllm Example
```python
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

model_id = "allenai/Olmo-3-7B-Think"
llm = LLM(model=model_id)

sampling_params = SamplingParams(
    temperature=0.6,
    top_p=0.95,
    max_tokens=32768,
)

prompt = "Who would win in a fight - a dinosaur or a cow named MooMoo?"
outputs = llm.generate(prompt, sampling_params)
print(outputs[0].outputs[0].text)
```


## Bias, Risks, and Limitations
Like any base language model or fine-tuned model without safety filtering, these models can easily be prompted by users to generate harmful and sensitive content. Such content may also be produced unintentionally, especially in cases involving bias, so we recommend that users consider the risks when applying this technology. Additionally, many statements from OLMo or any LLM are often inaccurate, so facts should be verified.
